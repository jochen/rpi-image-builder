using docker to create my own raspbian images
(this example just enable ssh)

make targets

build-rpi-builder: build the image with qemu stuff to build the raspbian creater

build-rpi-docker-img: run the container with qemu and build the basic raspbian image

build-rpi-creater: build sdcard creater image from the raspbian image

create-rpi-img: run sdcard image creation
